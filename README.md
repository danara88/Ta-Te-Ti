## Game Tic Tac Toe
This is my final python project made with python applying different concepts of this language. This was a project made by myself at AUSTRAL University of Argentina.

## What technologies did I use :question:
I only used python without any framework or librarie.

## What I learn in this project :question:
While I was developing this program, I learn how to use data structrures with python and using other methods to manipulate lists, tuplas and dicts. It was a little beat hard at the beginning but then I finished the program.
